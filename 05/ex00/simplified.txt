1. Create a `Warlock` class with private attributes:
   - `name` (string) X
   - `title` (string) X

2. Implement the following getters:
   - `getName`, returning a reference to a constant string
   - `getTitle`, returning a reference to a constant string
   Both should be callable on a constant `Warlock` object.

3. Implement the setter:
   - `setTitle`, returning void, taking a reference to a constant string

4. Add a constructor that takes the name and title as parameters. The `Warlock` should not be copyable, instantiable by copy, or instantiable without a name and title.

5. Upon creation, the `Warlock` should say:
   - `<NAME>: This looks like another boring day.`

6. Upon death, the `Warlock` should say:
   - `<NAME>: My job here is done!`

7. Implement the function:
   - `void introduce() const;`

8. The `introduce` function should display:
   - `<NAME>: I am <NAME>, <TITLE>!`

9. Create a test main function as provided in the example.

10. Compile and run the program, ensuring that the output matches the specified format.

Remember to replace placeholders like `<NAME>`, `<TITLE>`, etc., with the appropriate values.
